Exercise Description
In this exercise, you'll train a model that can classify images of articles of clothing from the popular Fashion MNIST dataset.

After that you'll convert the trained model to TF Lite format where it could be used on a mobile or embedded system.

You'll then use the standalone TF Lite Interpreter, which runs in Python, and you'll use this to see how inference would work on smaller devices!
