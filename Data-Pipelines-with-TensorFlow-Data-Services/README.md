# Parallelize Various Stages of the ETL Processes
## The following exercises are about parallelizing various stages of Extract, Transform and Load processes.
## In particular, you will be tasked with performing following tasks:

### Parallelize the extraction of the stored TFRecords of the cats_vs_dogs dataset by using the interleave operation.
### Parallelize the transformation during the preprocessing of the raw dataset by using the map operation.
### Cache the processed dataset in memory by using the cache operation for faster retrieval.
### Parallelize the loading of the cached dataset during the training cycle by using the prefetch operation.
